      <h1> The chair </h1>
      <p>in my room across from my bed is from a used garage sale. It only cost $5. The upholstery is a faded <mark>red</mark> color but the fabric is still soft to sit on. The wood trim around the back and legs of the chair is light brown and cracked at some parts. The chair back is curved, molding to whoever sits there, with the low arms coming up at either side. The chair arms arenâ€™t very comfortable to relax your arms on, but they are made of the same soft fabric as the rest of the chair.</p>
